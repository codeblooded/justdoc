# Contributing
Glad you want to contribute to this project!  While guidelines can be a pain, they greatly help to make it easier to maintain the project. Please read and follow these guidelines.  

## Issues
To make sure issues are resolved in a timely manner, please mark issues with the appropriate labels.  Please do not add a milestone or assign someone, unless you have specifically been asked to do so or have commit access. Please keep this in mind when writing your summary:
- Explain what you were doing when the bug was noticed
- Detail the software you are using (OS, Ruby Version, Gem Version, etc.) 
- If any workarounds were found, please describe them (you can also submit a patch :smile:)
- Watch the Issue and feel free to pressure us (we want the best for the project)

## Code Guidelines
Please only contribute code following this syntax:
- No Tabs, use 2 Spaces for any Ruby files
- After each method, please include a single line (no more, no less)
- Comment Thoroughly (no comments = rejected / it makes it hard to keep up with the project :tired_face:)!
- Every file, method, and class should have documentation as comments (follow the format)
- Try to write a test for anything you can!

## Pull Request Guidelines
Only send in pull requests that follow these guidelines:
- Test your patch thoroughly!!!
- Provide a failing test that your patch fixes
- Describe Changes (be verbose), and Include examples if needed
- Prepare to answer any questions about certain lines of code or the patch in general
- If your patch is merged, add an entry to the CHANGELOG on [RevisionIO](http://revision.io/iHFKzKYTef870uW1VeUf3OIQY032SIED20jD-Axy)
- Keep the Git log clean and squash your commits
- You get credit for the commit, so, if a change is required before merging, let us know if you plan to make the change
- Make sure to use `Fix #ISSUE` or `CLOSE #ISSUE` in the commit message if it closes a specific issue
- Refer to the `#ISSUE` in the commit message if it impacts or concerns an issue in any way
- Don't just +1 a pull request, give constructive feedback (BE NICE!)
